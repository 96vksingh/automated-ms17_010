# automated-ms17_010
Small autmoated code for ms17_010 exploit .

The code works on all Kali Linux OS .

Set the interface in start.sh to eth0 or wlan0 based on your choice, Default : wlan0 .

Just run it and wait for the notification of test completed.

At present the code works only for windows 7 x64 architecture, more OS to be added later.

You can also edit the code and change the setting and run the automation. it is very simple.

THE Code is still with small bugs.

Any contribution is welcome.

HAPPY HACKING
